<p>Travel Experts is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information that you provide to us when using the Travel Experts web site. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information received about you when you visit Travel Experts.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Promise</h4>
<p>While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is our clients&#8217; trust. Keeping client information secure, and using it only as our clients would want us to, is a top priority for all of us at Travel Experts. Here then, is our promise to our individual customers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We will safeguard, according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information our customers share with us.</li>
    <li>We will limit the collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to deliver superior service to our customers, which includes advising our customers about our products, services and other opportunities, and to administer our business.</li>
    <li>We will permit only authorized employees, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Promise will be subject to our normal disciplinary process.</li>
    <li>We will not reveal customer information to any external organization unless we have previously informed the customer in disclosures or agreements, or are required by law.</li>
    <li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of our customer information. We may, however, share customer information with reputable companies when a customer has expressed an interest in their service or product. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these other companys use of customer information.</li>
    <li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.</li>
    <li>We will attempt to keep customer files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. We will tell our customers how and where to conveniently access their information (except when we&#8217;re prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information We Collect</h4>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<p>When you register, and at other times, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and facts about your computer. We do not, however, knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. In addition, if a user is under 18, unless consent is obtained from your parent/guardian, you are not allowed to provide us with personal information.</p>

<p>We automatically collect IP addresses and Web site usage information from you when you visit our Web site. This information helps us evaluate how our visitors and customers use and navigate our Web site on an aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of visitors and customers to each Web page, and the length of their visits.</p>
<h4>How We Use Information Collected</h4>
<p>We may use information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information.</li>
